`visiumStitched` is intended to provide re-usable functions helpful for
various analyses in the [spatialNAc
project](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatial_NAc). Code is
maintained here in an R package for ease of use, and to ensure dependent
`spatialNAc` code can easily refer to the latest functions here.

For details, check the [documentation
site](http://research.libd.org/visiumStitched/).
