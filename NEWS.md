# visiumStitched 0.99.0

NEW FEATURES

* Initial version of the `visiumStiched` package that provides utilities for
stitching together Visium capture areas and enables seamless downstream
spatially-aware clustering methods to identify clusters on the stitched data.
An example postmortem human brain dataset composed of 3 Visium capture areas
was generated to demonstrate the utility of `visiumStitched`. The dataset is
available from `spatiaLIBD::fetch_data()` version 1.17.8 or newer. The example
data is described at <https://research.libd.org/visiumStitched_brain/>.
